##  Welcome!

My name is Michelle Chan and I will be hosting the majority of my work here. These include: academic coursework, student research projects, links to personal visualization projects and resume.

Most of the presented work will be related to data analysis and data visualization, and research projects that I am involved with.

## About Me


I graduated from University of Toronto (UofT) in June 2019, where I pursued a specialist program in Applied Statistics and a minor in Mathematics, graduated with distinction.

Iâ€™m currently an Analyst under the Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) Analytics team at Deloitte Canada, in Toronto. My role focuses on three business areas to drive values for clients through leveraging analytics (1) to generate deeper data-driven insights and optimize decisions across the M&A cycle; (2) to drive productivity and cost control for operational efficiency; and (3) to identify opportunities for profitable revenue growth.
